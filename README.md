# very_simple_calc

My first Dart test application.

   "Bugs":
       1) operations are not repeated. For example, while pressing Calculate few
       times, calculator still counts only once, but possible to change operation
       and get correct result;
       2) can't delete just one digit, need to press C and start again;
       3) may put many zeros before dot, but calculator gives correct result,
       for example, 0000.01 + 0000000000.1 will still give 0.11;
       4) if not to choose first number and choose any operation and enter
       second number - program gives error.

     Although, calculator's functionality works in case of correct usage.
